    <h3>Arduino Workshop</h3>
    <p>This is the place to be for all you robotics lovers. You thought making a robot is rocket science and so you just dropped the idea, but believe us, making robots with Arduino is so simple that anyone even without any programming or electronics background can do it !<br/><br/>
So, i.Fest '12, DA-IICT brings to you this workshop which will give you a headstart in making robots and in just ONE DAY you will have learnt how to make your own line-follower bot right from scratch. <br/><br/>
The the circuits, the physics, the logic and the code everything would be done by you and we will help you crack it all by yourself !!!<br/><br/>
The details of the workshop are as follows:<br/><br/>

    <h3>SixthSense Botz</h3>
    <p>Ever wondered why we humans can see things around us, and differentiate between colors which the machines fail to do?
<br/><br/>Now, get ready for a workshop called “SixthSense Botz” which will answer all your questions and leave you with 
a memorable experience to connect the interface digital world with physical world. For the forthcoming iFest Season,IEEE student branch DA-IICT in collaboration with ARK Technologies brings you a 2 day workshop which will teach you:
<li>Color Recognition Application</li>
<li>Ball following robot</li>
<li>Gesture controlled robot</li>
<li>Gesture controlled windows media player</li>
<li>Gesture controlled mouse pointer (demo) </li> <br/>

All these days the participants would have used traditional sensors like IR, ultrasonic, LDR sensors etc. which were used for sensing an obstacle or light, but these sensors where never able tell the robot the color of the light or the type of obstacle present in front of the robot. In this two day workshop, using a camera, the robot will be able to tell what the robot is sensing.
<br/><br/>

    <h4>Other Details:</h4>
    <li>Dates for the workshop: 29th and 30th September 2012</li>
<li>Fee for the workshop: Rs. 5000 for a team of 5</li>
<li>Last date for registration: 27th September 2012</li>

    <h3>Arduino Mela</h3>
    <p>Participants showcasing innovative models made using Arduino board<br/><br/>
We all have been to 'MELA'. Whether big or small, MELAS always have lights and sound and the hustle-bustle of people. There are magicians and performers doing various tricks to impress you and grab your attention.<br/>
We want to create the same 'MELA' here at DA-IICT, so we bring to you a competition where you will get : chart papers, colors, glue and all that an artist inside you would need, but that's not it, you will also get Arduino boards, LEDs, buzzers, soldering irons and all that an engineer inside you would need. <br/>
What you have to do is just create anything that is fun and anything that will attract the passersby!!!<br/><br/>
<b>For inspiration visit:</b><br/>
<li><a href = "http://www.creativeapplications.net/category/arduino-2/">http://www.creativeapplications.net/category/arduino-2/</a></li>
<li><a href = "http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=simple+creative+arduino+projects&oq=simple+creative+arduino+projects&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_l=youtube.3...2160l3160l0l3390l7l7l0l0l0l0l150l700l3j4l7l0">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=simple+creative+arduino+projects&oq=simple+creative+arduino+projects&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_l=youtube.3...2160l3160l0l3390l7l7l0l0l0l0l150l700l3j4l7l0</a> </li> <br/>
But you don't need to be so hi-fi, just create a simple 'bhompu' that shows volume levels in a cool way, and it will just be too good!!!<br/>
So come, and show what the electronic artist inside you can do. You don't need to write a 100 line code, just write a one line code to blink an LED and use it creatively with the stuff provided to do something cool!!!<br/>
We would provide you with basic logistics you need however you can also bring you own junk(But do bring along pens and pencils in case you need!!). Also if you need any special component then you would have to bring it yourself. Your project will be evaluated keeping in mind the attractiveness. However you can be asked to show and explain the codes of Arduino that you have used. You can bring your own laptops or else we would provide you with desktop.<br/>
<br/><b>Time allotted</b>: 3 hours, <b> 6th October </b>.
<br/>You can learn the basics quite easily and if you need then we can also provide some help from us to learn basics!!!<br/>

<br/><b>Participation charges</b>: No participation charges!<br/><br/>
You can participate individually or in a team of 3 members max. <br/>
